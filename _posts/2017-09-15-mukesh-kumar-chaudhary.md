## Introduction
I am an enthusiastic devops engineer at Hamropatro. My skills have expanded until now. I am one of the NOSK member too. I have used a wide range of technologies. My expertise is in web-based technologies, Django/Micronaut for backend, React/Vue for frontend, containerization [Docker+Kubernetes+Proxmox]. I have experience with remote work, working with teams across the globe over Github/Gitlab+Trello. 

I like to keep an open mind about adopting new technologies. I can adapt fairly quickly to new teams and dev-stacks.
